# gdp-pop-cpi
Chart US GDP per capita normalized using the CPI (formula: GDP/population/CPI). Call it productivity per worker? 

This chart is basically saying: **The amount of good/services produced per worker has risen 2.3x from 1947-2020.** Inflation is accounted for by dividing pure GDP dollar values by the consumer price index for the given year.
